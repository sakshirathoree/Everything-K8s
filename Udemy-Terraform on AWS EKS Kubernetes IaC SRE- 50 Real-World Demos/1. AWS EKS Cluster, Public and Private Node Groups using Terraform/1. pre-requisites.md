## üõ†Ô∏è ‚úÖ AWS EKS Prerequisites (Infrastructure Setup)




### 1. **VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)**
- Custom VPC to isolate your resources.
- Define CIDR block (e.g., `10.0.0.0/16`).

---

### 2. **Subnets**
- At least **2 Private Subnets** in different AZs for worker nodes.
- At least **2 Public Subnets** (optional, usually for NAT GW or load balancer ingress).
- Required for **HA setup** and EKS control plane communication.

---

### 3. **Internet Gateway**
- Allows outbound internet access from public subnets.
- Attached to the VPC.

---

### 4. **Route Tables**
- **Public Route Table**:
  - Associated with public subnets.
  - Routes traffic to the Internet Gateway.
- **Private Route Table**:
  - Associated with private subnets.
  - Routes internet-bound traffic via NAT Gateway.

---

### 5. **NAT Gateway + Elastic IP**
- Needed for **private subnets** to access the internet (e.g., for pulling container images).
- Usually deployed in a **public subnet** with an Elastic IP.

---

### 6. **Security Groups**
- One for the **EKS Control Plane to Node Communication**.
- One for **worker nodes** (allow SSH/internal traffic).
- Optionally, one for **Bastion Host** to restrict SSH access.

---

### 7. **Bastion Host (Optional, but common in Prod)**
- An EC2 instance in a **public subnet** for SSH access to worker nodes in private subnets.
- Associated with:
  - A Security Group allowing SSH access from your office IP.
  - An Elastic IP for access.

---

### 8. **EC2 Key Pair (Optional but recommended)**
- Used to SSH into Bastion Host or Worker nodes (for troubleshooting).

---

## üì¶ Optional But Useful
- **SSM Agent Enabled + IAM Role** if you want to avoid bastion and use Session Manager.
- **CloudWatch Logs setup** for VPC Flow Logs or node logging.
- **Tags** on all resources for visibility, billing, and EKS discovery.

---

## üìå Visual Flow (Simplified)

```
         [Your Laptop]
               |
         [Bastion Host] <-- Elastic IP (Public Subnet)
               |
        [Worker Nodes in Private Subnet]
               |
           [NAT Gateway] <-- Elastic IP
               |
         [Internet Gateway]
```

## üß† Reminder

When you use the **Terraform EKS module**, you can either:
- **Provide your own VPC and subnet IDs** (like above), or
- Let the module **create the VPC and subnets for you** (for faster setup in non-prod).

Let me know if you'd like a **Terraform script** to create this full infra setup or a **diagram** to visualize the flow.


------------------

# nat g/w is attached to? just like igw is attached to vpc?



Yes, just like the **Internet Gateway (IGW)** is **attached directly to the VPC**, the **NAT Gateway (NAT GW)** works **a bit differently**:

---

## üö™ NAT Gateway ‚Äì Attachment Overview

### ‚ùì Is NAT Gateway "attached" to something?
Not in the same way as an IGW is attached to a VPC.

### ‚úÖ NAT Gateway is:
- **Created in a Public Subnet** (you specify the subnet during creation).
- **Associated with an Elastic IP** (EIP).
- **Used by private subnets via a route in the route table**.

---

### üîÅ Flow: How Private Subnets Use NAT GW

1. **NAT GW lives in a public subnet**.
2. **Private subnet‚Äôs route table** has a rule:
   ```
   0.0.0.0/0 ‚Üí NAT Gateway ID
   ```
3. This allows **outbound internet access** from private subnets (e.g., for `yum update`, pulling Docker images), **without exposing the private subnet to inbound internet traffic**.

---

## üîÅ Comparison: IGW vs NAT GW

| Feature                  | Internet Gateway (IGW)       | NAT Gateway                     |
|--------------------------|------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Attached to              | VPC                          | Public Subnet (indirectly)       |
| Used by                  | Public Subnets               | Private Subnets (via Route Table)|
| Supports inbound traffic | ‚úÖ Yes                       | ‚ùå No (only outbound)            |
| Requires Elastic IP?     | ‚ùå Optional (via EC2)         | ‚úÖ Yes                           |

## üìù Example Terraform Snippet (Route Table for Private Subnet)
```hcl
resource "aws_route_table" "private" {
  vpc_id = aws_vpc.main.id

  route {
    cidr_block     = "0.0.0.0/0"
    nat_gateway_id = aws_nat_gateway.main.id
  }

  tags = {
    Name = "private-route-table"
  }
}
```
