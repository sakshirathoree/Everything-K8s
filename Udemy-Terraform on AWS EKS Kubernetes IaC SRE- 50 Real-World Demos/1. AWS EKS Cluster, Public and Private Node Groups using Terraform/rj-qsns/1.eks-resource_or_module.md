# So the advantage of using TerraForm Resources over TerraForm module for EKS cluster is:

- if we use the resources like 'aws_eks_cluster', 'aws_eks_addon', aws_eks_node_group', we'll build everything from the scratch like eks iam role, node group, etc
- we'll have full control over resources provisioned by us
- we'll dissect EKS cluster & will learn every internal of EKS Cluster.

# 1. there are 2 options to create eks cluster using terraform,
one using tf resources, and other using tf modules from
 tf public registery, which to use?

 -----------------------------

 Great question, Jatin!

When deciding between using **Terraform native AWS resources** (`aws_eks_cluster`, `aws_eks_node_group`, etc.) and using a **Terraform module** (like the one from the [Terraform Registry](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/terraform-aws-modules/eks/aws)), it depends on a few key factors.

Here’s a comparison to help you decide:

---

### ✅ Option 1: **Using Terraform Modules (e.g., terraform-aws-modules/eks/aws)**

#### 📌 Pros:
- **Saves time & effort**: Abstracts a lot of boilerplate code.
- **Best practices built-in**: Secure defaults, tagging, IAM roles, etc.
- **Handles complexity**: Supports managed node groups, Fargate, IRSA, KMS encryption, logging, etc.
- **Regularly maintained**: By the community and HashiCorp partners.
- **Highly customizable** via input variables.

#### 🔧 Example:
```hcl
module "eks" {
  source          = "terraform-aws-modules/eks/aws"
  cluster_name    = "my-cluster"
  cluster_version = "1.28"
  subnets         = var.subnets
  vpc_id          = var.vpc_id
  ...
}
```

#### 🧠 Use this if:
- You want **faster setup**.
- You prefer **maintainability** over granular control.
- You’re working in **teams or production** and want proven, reusable code.

---

### ✅ Option 2: **Using Native Terraform AWS Resources (`aws_eks_cluster`, etc.)**

#### 📌 Pros:
- **Complete control**: You know exactly what's being created.
- **Fine-tuned customization** for learning or edge cases.
- **Good for learning** how EKS works behind the scenes.

#### 📉 Cons:
- More code and complexity to manage.
- You need to handle things like node IAM roles, security groups, etc. manually.

#### 🧠 Use this if:
- You want to **learn deeply** how EKS is configured.
- You have **very specific requirements** the module doesn’t support.
- You’re building a **minimal POC or educational demo**.

### 🔍 Summary Table

| Criteria                     | Terraform Module (`terraform-aws-modules/eks`) | Native AWS Resources (`aws_eks_*`) |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Ease of use                 | ✅ Easy                                           | ❌ Verbose                         |
| Customizability             | ✅ High                                           | ✅ Very High                       |
| Learning / Deep understanding | ❌ Abstracted                                   | ✅ Good for learning               |
| Production-readiness        | ✅ Recommended                                    | ✅ If well-coded                  |
| Maintenance                 | ✅ Maintained module                              | ❌ You maintain all logic         |

### 🔥 My Recommendation:
For **real-world use**, **production deployments**, and **faster delivery**:  
👉 Go with the **Terraform Registry module** (`terraform-aws-modules/eks/aws`).

For **deep learning**, **custom lab setups**, or when you want **complete control**:  
👉 Use the **native `aws_eks_*` resources**.

Let me know if you want a starter example for either approach!

That actually makes a lot of sense — and you're not alone, Jatin.

Even though modules like `terraform-aws-modules/eks/aws` are *highly recommended* for production, **some teams still go with native Terraform resources** for a few reasons:

---

### 🧾 Why Your Previous Project Might Have Used Native Resources:

#### 1. 🔍 **Full Control & Customization**
- They might have had **very specific requirements** for VPC, IAM roles, security groups, or EKS behavior that weren't easily handled by the module.
- For example: integrating with custom logging systems, internal private DNS, or strict security constraints.

#### 2. 🧠 **Deep Understanding & Ownership**
- Some teams prefer to **build their infrastructure from scratch** to deeply understand what’s being provisioned.
- This gives them full transparency and control over every component.

#### 3. 🛠️ **Legacy or Initial Setup**
- The project may have started **before the module became stable or mature**.
- Migrating to the module from native resources isn't always straightforward, especially in production, due to state drift.

#### 4. 🔄 **Compliance & Security Reviews**
- If their org had **security or compliance audits**, they may have opted for explicit resource creation so every resource was traceable and documented line-by-line.

---

### 🔁 So… Which Should YOU Use Going Forward?

If you're building something new or managing infra that may grow over time:
> ✅ **Use the EKS module** unless you have strong reasons not to.  
It saves time, includes battle-tested patterns, and reduces maintenance overhead.

But if you're:
- Supporting or extending an existing setup
- Following an org-wide pattern or compliance rule
> 🔧 Then sticking with **native resources** might be required.

### 🧠 TL;DR

| Use Case                          | Recommended Approach         |
|----------------------------------|------------------------------|
| New production cluster setup     | ✅ Terraform EKS Module       |
| Highly customized setup          | 🔧 Native Terraform Resources |
| Compliance-heavy org             | 🔧 Native or auditable infra |
| Quick dev/testing cluster        | ✅ Module or native (flexible)|
| Existing legacy infrastructure   | 🔧 Stick with what’s used     |
