Today is 5th april 2025(9:12 am IST), I'm at my new home in Park Astra, hinjewadi, Pune. 
I've recently joined IBM as a DevOps Engineer.
I had my internal interview with us team on last thursday & I felt I need to work a bit on **eks & k8s related components.**
I've been creating related docs but they were parted in multiple folders, hencedecided to create this repo,
where I'll be storing everything, **the concepts I learn, POC's, work, etc**
